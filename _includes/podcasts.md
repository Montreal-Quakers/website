* Recommended: [Quaker Faith and Podcast](https://quakerpodcast.org/category/episodes/season-2/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} by Mackenzie and Micah. 
  * It struggles with the big questions of what do Quakers believe. They write: "Most Quakers today were not raised Quakers. In Britain, that’s as high as 87%! That’s a lot of religion education to pick up, and smaller meetings often have trouble providing education for the full learning curve from newcomer to seasoned Quaker. We hope to make it easier to learn what Quaker believe."
* Also recommended, [QuakerSpeak](https://quakerspeak.com/recent/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} speaks to Quakers about their Faith. 
  * QuakerSpeak is a Quaker YouTube channel where Jon interviews Friends of all different backgrounds and ask them the core questions of our faith.
