There are several ways to learn more about the Quaker tradition.
* Join us once a month as we have an introduction to Quaker event at meeting.
  * For instance, [a presentation on the Quaker Institute for the Future](/2020/04/14/quaker-institute-future).
* Check out a pamphlet or book from our library about Quakerism and Quaker history. Feel free to [ask for suggestions](/contact).
* Online courses in Quakerism are offered by Canadian Yearly Meeting. You can browse the material anytime [here](http://quaker.ca/resources/education/#Introduction_to_Quakers_and_Friends_Ways){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. If you're interested, [contact us](/contact) to be put on the online course mailing list.
  * [Woodbrooke Study Centre](https://moodle.woodbrooke.org.uk/?){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} and [Pendle Hill](https://pendlehill.org/learn/workshops-courses-events/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} both offer online classes about Quakerism that are well worth a look.
  * See the [links and history](/links_history) for resources and links to other Quaker bodies.
  * Check out this list of [podcast suggestions](/next_steps/podcasts).
* Perhaps the best way: ask someone to have coffee to speak more in depth and from personal experience.
