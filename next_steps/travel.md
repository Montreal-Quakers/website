If you're travelling or moving somewhere, don't hesitate to ask the clerk for a [letter of introduction](#introduction). Forward this letter in your communication to local Quakers at your destination and they will be even more likely to connect you with people who can help, places to eat, things to see, or perhaps even places to stay. Some local meetinghouses, such as [Toronto Meeting](https://www.torontoquakers.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, may even have accommodations available. So, although a [letter of introduction](#introduction) isn't required, it certainly can't hurt. Either way, whether travelling with or without such a letter, we encourage you to [contact local meetings](#contact): it's a great way to meet wonderful local Quakers, and better know your destination. It may be best to [contact us](/contact) to learn more before reaching out.

## Moving elsewhere

If you're moving somewhere, don't hesitate to ask the clerk for a [letter of introduction](#introduction). This can help local Quakers know who you are: they may be even more likely to offer local tips and tricks, job and housing opportunities, and useful connections, even well before you move.

## Bringing greetings

When Quakers travel, we often bring greetings from our home meeting to other meetings. Unless this greeting is officially minuted by the clerk (for example, in a [letter of introduction](#introduction)), it is often called "unofficial greetings," but Quakers often "bring greetings," even if unofficialy, when introducing themselves in another Quaker meeting. It's a nice thing to say if you remember to do it.

### Letters of Introduction <span class="stanchor"><a name="introduction"> </a></span>

A letter of introduction is a communication signed by the clerk that identifies the person who is traveling as a member or regular attender in good standing. This can be useful when visiting or moving somewhere.

### Minutes of Travel <span class="stanchor"><a name="travel"> </a></span>

Distinct from a [letter of introduction](#introduction), a travel minute is usually for a trip concerning Quaker business, for instance, someone who travels to many meetings to listen or teach. A travel minute is a formal document from a meeting on behalf of a member or attender introducing the Friend and the reason for the trip. Unlike a letter of introduction, a minute of travel from the clerk must have approval of the meeting. If the Friend is traveling extensively outside of Canada, it is also appropriate for the letter to be approved by the yearly meeting and signed by its clerk.

### Monthly meeting <span class="stanchor"><a name="monthly"> </a></span>

Quakers have a tradition of referring to a Quaker body by how often business meeting happens. A yearly meeting holds its business sessions annually whereas a monthly meeting has business once a month. But most monthly meetings hold meeting for worship once per week.
