It continues with a close look at systems of governance for the commons, and a new look at human nature's capacity for cooperative, collaborative action on behalf of the common good.

9780993672538,Tracking Down Ecological Guidance,1,"Tracking Down Ecological Guidance is a road map to an emerging worldview. For several centuries the effect of the industrial revolution has been to reinforce the cultural assumption that Earth is just a storehouse of raw materials for human use, and the faster these resources are exploited the better off the human species will be. This exploitive worldview is failing; it no longer provides believable guidance for the human future. The ecological worldview now emerging is focused on what kind of readaptation makes sense given what is known about how Earth's ecosystems actually work. The essays gathered in Tracking Down Ecological Guidance compose a panorama of the author's engagement with the trajectories of culture and economic behaviour over the past fifty years. While the conflict between the growth economy and ecosystem integrity is central to the book, it is also focused on the means of ""spiritual survival"" - the ability to keep working for human betterment and environmental integrity despite the worst that may happen. As the failed adaptation of the industrial-consumer era plays out, the rise of an alternative, ecologically integrated economy becomes essential for human wellbeing. This book charts a journey through the ""storm of progress"" to an ecological worldview anchored in beauty and expressed in ""right relationship"" to our home places, and to the whole Earth. The book moves beyond the temptation of fatalism to a strategy for enhancing both economic and spiritual survival. Keith Helmuth is a founding member of Quaker Institute for the Future, and a co-author of Right Relationship: Building a Whole Earth Economy.

9781988299228,Who Are We?,1,"Although Edith Miller was always a writer, she took up the composition of poems in the last decades of her life, a time when those who savour the resonance of words often wish to put their love of life and the beauty of the world into a legacy of language. With the publication of Crow Impressions and Other Poems in 2016, Edith did just that. With the publication of Who Are We? she has added a further contribution to this great tradition. In both books, we encounter the unmistakable imprint of the spirit and energy that animated Edith and her creative work. But what has impressed me most as I have worked with her poems and prepared her books for publication, is the recurring presence of family in what she chooses to celebrate. It has been noted that Edith was the centreing presence of her family, but clearly when she came to focus on what mattered most, family was the centreing presence for her. At the memorial celebrating her life, husband, Michael, and sons, Andrew, Nate, and Joel formed a combo to play some of Edith's favourite music, including jazz tunes. At the conclusion, they picked up their instruments and continued to play as they proceeded down the aisle from the front of the chapel to the rear. Michael led with a little dance step, followed by Joel on the sax, Andrew playing the double bass, and Nate with a hand drum. It was an astounding moment of celebration in the midst of sorrow by those most affected. It was as if the family, in their natural mode of creativity, had made itself into a tangible expression of the spirit in which Edith lived. The effect was utterly transporting; Edith's family had lifted the celebration into communion with an imperishable love of life. Between her two books, Edith completed sixty-five poems for publication. Although this is a modest number, the amplitude of her work continues to evoke appreciative response from those who discover it. My thanks to Joel Miller for his enthusiastic coordination of the work it took to create Who Are We? The manuscript was yet to be titled when we began preparing it for publication. Joel chose the title from one of the poems. No second thought was needed. It was a perfect fit. I am sure Edith would agree.
