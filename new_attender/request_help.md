As an attender, you more than are welcome to request help from the meeting, which can take several forms:
* [Emergency financial help](/new_attender/discretionary_fund) from the meeting of up to $250 is available to members and attenders, who may apply up to twice a year
* We can form a Clearness Committee to help members and attenders make important and difficult decisions
* A Committee of Care can be created to help care for and support a member or attender in need, for instance, in case of hospitalization or stress
* Our Ministry & Counsel committee can help find other kinds of support for members and attenders. You are not alone
* During the COVID outbreak, we set up a special fund to help members and attenders. Feel free to ask us anytime how we're responding to challenging circumstances
