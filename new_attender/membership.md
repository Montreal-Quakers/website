## The role of membership for Montreal Quakers
Some people attend meeting and even serve on Quaker committees for many years without being a member. Anyone, member or attender, is welcome at meeting; anyone may attend and even share ministry at meeting and at business meeting; members and regular attenders can serve on committees. 

That said, membership is important, even if there are few specific distinctions or privileges that come with it.

## The purpose of membership
* We are all shaped by experiences. At some point, becoming a member — "being" a Quaker — is simply an honest statement that we have been shaped by this Quaker community, among many other influences
* Membership should be a leading from Spirit, in other words, an expression of love for and within this community, our membership in a kind of spiritual family
* The purpose of the membership process is to discern whether this love is present, and if so, to recognize and celebrate it
* Membership also may serve to signal a desire for inclusion and contribution

## Responsibilities and privileges of membership
Membership serves as an affirmation of participation in a kind of spiritual family. Membership implies a desire to enter joyfully into the activities of the community:
* To attend its Meetings for Worship and Business
* To give service through its committees and otherwise
* To share financially to an appropriate degree
* To learn and deepen as an individual and in our shared tradition

For its part, the meeting community engages to support its members.

We encourage applications for membership from those who, after a reasonable period of attendance and study, desire to join the Society.
## The membership process
1. The interested person writes a letter to the Clerk stating a wish to apply for membership. This letter can be long or short and may answer questions such as:
  * How long have you been attending?
  * How involved are you?
  * What makes you want to be a member?
  * What has your faith journey been like?
2. Give that letter to the clerk by hand, mail, or email
3. Someone from the Ministry & Counsel committee will be in touch to ask about who would be best to serve on the clearness committee for membership
4. The Clerk will read your letter and form a committee at the next business meeting
5. At the clearness committee meeting, committee members will ask the prospective member questions about topics such as their faith journey, relationship with wider Quakerism, and their place in the community
6. Once things are clear, which may not happen at the first meeting, the clearness committee may craft a recommendation to be presented at the next business meeting
7. The community will either accept or request further discernment about the recommendation of the clearness committee

If accepted, celebration is in order <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake fa-fw color-1-text"></i>
