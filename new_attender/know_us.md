If you'd like to be more involved but you're not sure how, perhaps the best thing to do is to express this feeling to the clerk, nominations committee, Ministry & Counsel member, or just ask around. Sometimes we are simply unaware of your wish. Here are a couple of other suggestions:
* [Inquire](/contact.html) about our [book club/Bible study](/new_attender/book_bible) or [singing group](/new_attender/singing_group)
* Add our [meeting calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=clerk%40montreal.quaker.ca&ctz=America%2FToronto){:  rel="noopener" target="_blank"} to your calendar ([instructions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en){:  rel="noopener" target="_blank"})
* Often after meeting we stay and chat and go out for lunch. Join us, or invite someone you like for coffee
* Volunteer with us. Some of our members have been volunteering at:
  * Homeless shelters
  * Teaching art to refugee children
  * With community groups such as Solidarity Across Borders and non-profits such as Council of Canadians
* Joining a [committee](/new_attender/committees.html) is a great way to know us better and contribute to the life of the meeting community
  * If one of the [committees](/new_attender/committees.html) might interest you, feel free to inquire
  * If you don't see a role that might interest you, perhaps ask anyway: there are many fascinating ways to join and serve Quakers in Canada, at interfaith groups, in North America, the UN, and the world. That list is only the beginning
* Do you know about larger Quaker [gatherings](/new_attender/gatherings)?

## Asking vs. being asked
If you've been with us for a while, hopefully someone has discussed many of these items with you. If we haven't approached you, it may be because:
* We're a volunteer organization; we may not be as pro-active as some places with paid staff due to limited volunteer energy
* It is completely against our [values](/intro) to pressure people into serving on committees or membership. We are leery — sometimes too leery — of arm-twisting, sometimes hesitating quite a bit before bringing up some of these topics, particularly membership.
  * We want the Spirit of love, and not a sense of obligation, to guide decisions

We know it's awkward to ask. We hope you'll be patient with us. Knowing your interests helps us welcome you better, so thank you.
