## Travelling

If you're travelling somewhere, don't hesitate to ask the clerk for a [travel minute](#travel). Forward this minute in your communication to local Quakers and they will be even more likely to give you tips on places to eat, siteseeing, and perhaps even places to stay. This minute isn't required but it can't hurt. Either way, [contact local meetings](#contact): it's a great way to know a place and wonderful people. Sometimes, a local meetinghouse, such as [Toronto Meeting](https://www.torontoquakers.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, may even have accommodations available. In some cases, it may be best to [contact us](/contact) to learn more before reaching out.

## Moving elsewhere

If you're moving somewhere, don't hesitate to ask the clerk for a [letter of introduction](#introduction). This can help local Quakers know who you are: they may be even more likely to offer local tips and tricks, job and housing opportunities, and useful connections, even well before you move.

## Bringing greetings

When Quakers travel, we often bring greetings from our home meeting to other meetings. Unless this greeting is officially minuted by the clerk, it is often called "unofficial greetings," but Quakers often "bring greetings," even if unofficialy, when introducing themselves in another Quaker meeting. It's a nice thing to say if you remember to do it.

## [Definitions](https://www.fgcquaker.org/resources/explanation-letters-introduction-travel-minutes-and-endorsements){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
### Letters of Introduction <span class="stanchor"><a name="introduction"> </a></span>

A “letter of introduction” is a communication signed by the clerk of a monthly meeting that identifies the person who is traveling as a Friend or regular attender in good standing.
### Minutes of Travel <span class="stanchor"><a name="travel"> </a></span>

A “travel minute” is a formal document from a monthly meeting on behalf of a member or attender introducing the Friend and the reason for the trip. A minute of travel is endorsed by the clerk with approval of the meeting. If the Friend is traveling extensively outside of Canada, it is also appropriate for the letter to be approved by the yearly meeting and signed by its clerk.
