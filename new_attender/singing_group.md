Our singing group generally uses a few key resources:
* Rise Up Singing: The Group Singing Songbook by Peter Blood and Annie Patterson
* Worship in Song: A Friends Hymnal
* [Songs for singing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LcCqchfmrGPa6x6v4b1MS5PcfpQ1YCLT/view?usp=sharing){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}

## Practical details
No musical background or talent is required. We make music together to enjoy being and eating together

The group is potluck format, first we eat and then (on full bellies) we sing

We rotate homes that we meet and sing in

Bring an instrument and song suggestions if you like. Or else just show up
