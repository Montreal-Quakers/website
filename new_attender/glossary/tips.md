In the French-English glossary, reflexive verbs are placed in the alphabetical position corresponding to the verb itself, but they are none the less preceded by "se" or " s'... "

Cross-references to other entries within the glossary are indicated in capitals (e.g.: 'cf. CLERK')

The reference '**text.**' indicates that the expression in question is presented in its context in the section '[Some often-quoted Quaker texts](texts.html)'.

In French, nouns presented with a dash, e.g. Ami-e indicate that Ami is the masculine and Amie the feminine form.

If no gender is indicated, the noun can 
be either masculine or feminine.

In line with UN practice, the glossary uses British spelling in English.

English capitalises the initial letter of words more frequently than French. The capitals in this glossary have been chosen intentionally to correspond to normal usage in both French and English.
