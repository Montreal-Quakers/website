Hello everyone.

I announced some time ago the possibility of our meetings resuming on Sunday May 2. However, current sanitary conditions do not allow this. **This meeting is therefore canceled. However, it is planned that we will organize a meeting on Zoom during the month of May.** The purpose of this meeting will be to get to know people interested in the Quaker movement and to answer questions. You will be informed in advance. This meeting could be held on a weekday in the early evening but if you wish to participate and you have time constraints, let us know your availability and we will try to adjust.

Until then, be well and take care of yourself!

We all can't wait to see each other again.
