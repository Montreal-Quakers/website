Montreal Monthly Meeting, responding to proposals from several of its members, invites members from other monthly meetings and worship groups across Canada to take part in a series of online discussions about gender queer concerns. Our goal is to develop a Canadian Quaker response to gender queer needs within our community.

The term "Gender queer" covers issues of non-binary identity and gender fluidity as well as trans identity, and forms a continuum with, although distinct from, sexual orientation as expressed in the LGBTQ+ community.

We have identified several issues to consider. First, would it be useful to provide education to all about gender queer identities and pronoun use within our meetings? There are many different flavours of gender queer identity, and, indeed, pronoun suggestions often reflect that diversity. Even among those of us who identify as gender queer, there are questions and sources of confusion. Within the Quaker meeting, an enlarged understanding of this issue will, we believe, lead to greater love and understanding among Friends.

We also need to work out what, if any, positions to take as a community concerning the social and political dimensions of gender identity, which as you know, can be contentious and highly controversial. This requires nuanced discussion of all the issues from many different perspectives. We will need to be respectful and protective of each other during these discussions.

Third, we need to identify what measures might be taken within Quaker meetings and gatherings to support gender queer expression. The voices of both younger and older friends in this discussion are essential. Gender queer identities are generally more widely accepted and expressed among young people than older persons, but there are some among the latter who are hesitant to declare themselves based on a lifetime of difficulty. We need to be sensitive to all in our efforts, and we need to hear from a broad group of Quakers, whether or not you identify as non-binary or gender queer.

If you are interested in joining us, please contact Geoffreyjen Edwards at (Montreal Monthly Meeting)[https://montreal.quaker.ca/contact]. We foresee an organizational meeting in June (?) depending on availability of those wishing to attend. Once we have identified ourselves, we will consult on timing and set a date.

We believe this project to be a necessary and valuable one, not only because the issues of rights and justice are obviously important, but also because we will be able to share our experiences in this context across Canada. Together we may contribute to the transformation of our meetings into more inclusive and understanding communities of Friends. It will be joy to hear your experiences, and to share ours.
