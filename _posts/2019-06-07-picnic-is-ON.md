title: Picnic is ON!

The Quaker picnic is TOMORROW. The weather looks like it's going to be amazing so we are on.

1) Cutlery! Just a reminder for the picnic to please bring cutlery to eat with, and it can't hurt to bring plates either. There'll be salads and grilled deliciousness. Looking forward to seeing you all there!

2) Location! As mentioned in the sign-up form, consult [this map](https://goo.gl/maps/oUvCzTCDzgo) for a general idea where we'll be:

Once you get to that spot, look for us. It's first come first served on the picnic tables, so I can't say with too much precision exactly where we'll be. But we'll try to grab the corner picnic table just like last year. I'll try to show up early (or email me if you can show up around 10) to reserve us a picnic table. 

I'll also have a dark green and gold scarf that I'll try to attach to a tree or make visible somehow.

Directions: Metro/bus: We're about a 10 minute walk from metro Angrignon. Follow the paved path just past the big pond and we're in the corner just before the paved path turns off.
Car/taxi: last year, there was street parking available on Louis-HÃ©bert & Senkus. But that's the best place to be dropped off or to transport stuff. There's also a massive amount of parking near the metro.

3) If you get lost, feel free to call or email.

See you tomorrow!
