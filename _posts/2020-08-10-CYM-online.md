Canadian Yearly Meeting is meeting online this year. Fabulous opportunity to connect with Quakers across Canada.

The programming is [here](https://quaker.ca/yearlymeetinginsession/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
Note that conversations are happening on Zoom and on the CYM discord channel.

This is all inspiring the local meeting to start their own discord channel. Stay tuned for more information on that front.
