This past week, the Montreal Quaker Meeting website completed our work with [Agence SAT](https://agencesat.com/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, who conducted a full accessibility review of our website according to accessibility standards set by the governments of Quebec and Canada, and the international [WAI norms set by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/fr){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

Agence SAT also helped us design the website and draft our accessibility information page. Many thanks to the whole team for their assistance making our website more accessible, but also just more pleasant for everyone to use.

For more information on accessibility at the Montreal Quaker Meeting, see our [accessibility page](/accessibility).
