The Montreal Quaker Meeting will be hosting an open house on Sunday, December 9, 2018 at the Greene Centre, with a Q&A session with a longtime member after quiet worship and snacks. If you have been interested in coming to the Sunday meeting but felt a bit shy, this will be a great day to try it out and come ask questions. Weâ€™ll all be on our best behaviour (on time, name tags on). 

When: Sunday December 9 at 10:45 (or 12:45 for just the Q&A)
Where: Greene Centre, 1090 avenue Greene, Westmount
