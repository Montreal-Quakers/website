For those of us who knew Molly, we have some sad news to share: she passed away Thursday morning, peacefully in her sleep, at her nursing home in Westmount. All of us who knew Molly were inspired by her clarity and determination.

Originally from Chicago, Molly had been attending Montreal Quaker Meeting since she moved to Montreal in 1970. She had seen a number of transformations in the meeting over the course of more than 50 years.

Her family is inviting us to a service at [Collins Clarke MacGillivray White Funeral Homes](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/en-ca/funeral-homes/quebec/montreal/residences-funeraires-collins-clarke-macgillvray-white-funeral-homes/3101){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, Friday evening, June 28th at 5 pm, to which all are welcome. 

The address is [5610 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montr√©al, QC H4A1W5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ymtYRmnSAYaM9Ujf9){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

The Quakers are likely to hold another event to commemorate Molly at some point in the future.

Her son kindly sent some fun photos of Molly from her 20s (it's a prop):
