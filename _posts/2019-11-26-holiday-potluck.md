The singing potluck organizers would like to invite you to a holiday, singing-optional potluck on December 13th starting at 6pm at a member's home. Please RSVP by contacting us for the address, near Villa-Maria metro.

Last year was a beautiful event and we hope to see anyone who'd like to attend. FYI there will be singing but there will be space for non-singers as well.

We will be providing the space and counting on everyone to bring food to share. Please contact us if you'd like suggestions on what to bring
