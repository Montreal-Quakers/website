A couple of changes for our Sunday meeting.

First of all, we'll be meeting for 45 minutes rather than a full hour on Sundays, partially to keep Zoom fatigue to a minimum.

Second, we'll be beginning some activities after meeting on Zoom to exchange and have some fun.

* First Sunday is business meeting
* Second Sunday is a round-table check-in
* Third Sunday is discussion with the whole group with a prepared question prompt
* Fourth Sunday is small group discussion with a prompt
* Fifth Sunday is a surprise -- only way to find out is to show up

Feel free to [contact us](/contact) for more information or the meeting link.
