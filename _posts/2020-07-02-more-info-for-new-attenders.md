As promised [here](/2020/06/11/new-website.html), some new website features have just rolled out today:
* Glossary of French-English Quaker terminology!
* More information for new attenders on:
  * Business meeting
  * Learning more
  * Podcast recommendations
  * Meeting policies and resources

The website also just went through an accessibility review, which led to a few changes in the colour scheme and layout. More to come!
