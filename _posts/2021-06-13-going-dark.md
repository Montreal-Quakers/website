Part of accessibility is allowing websites to be accessed in the desired colour scheme. For this reason, many websites now allow their users to choose a light mode or dark mode.

In this same vein, the Montreal Quaker website now follows the browser default, all as part of our commitment to accessibility. Happy clicking!
