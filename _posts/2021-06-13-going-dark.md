Websites with darker themes are easier on the eyes and also use less battery. Part of accessibility is allowing users to choose how they want to access content. For this reason, many websites now allow their users to choose a light mode or dark mode.

In this same vein, the Montreal Quaker website is experimenting with following the browser default. We retouched the colours in the light theme as well. [Let us know what you think](/contact). 

Happy clicking!
