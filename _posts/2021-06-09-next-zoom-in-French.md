Our next French meeting on Zoom will take place on Thursday, June 17 at 7:30 p.m. (Quebec time). This will be the last meeting before the summer and we will resume this activity in September. We will begin with a period of silence lasting approximately fifteen minutes. Informal exchanges will follow. This is the time to ask questions about Quakerism, to offer readings or to discuss actions in your respective circles that are related to Quaker values. Any other subject that seems relevant to you will be welcome... we'll see what will be inspired by then.

Use [the contact form](/contact) for the Zoom link.

It will be a pleasure to meet or see you again.
