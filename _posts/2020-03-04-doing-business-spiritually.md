Every month we strive to hold an event after Sunday meeting (12:30 pm) whose goal is to hold a brief presentation and discussion about one aspect of Quaker life.

This month, on March 22nd, 2020, we'll be looking at how to conduct business grounded in worship as a community Spiritual business. One of the most unique, rewarding, and challenging aspects about Quaker tradition is our approach to business. What's involved, how do we make decisions without leaders? These are the questions we'll tackle at this Meeting for learning.
