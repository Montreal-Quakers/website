Every month we strive to hold an event after Sunday meeting (12:30 pm) whose goal is to hold a brief presentation and discussion about one aspect of Quaker life. 

This month, on January 26th, 2020 after meeting, the topic will be Quaker history, explored using role-play, and trivia, and we'll have special guests: the Quebec Association of Geography Teachers.
