We are happy to announce that we will carefully resume the in-person meetings [in Quebec](/qc) as of Sunday, May 2 at 1:00 p.m. at the All Saints chapel, [31 rue des Jardins in the Old Town, Qu√©bec](/qc), located in the courtyard of the Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral. Parking is available. You will notice that we had to change our schedule to accommodate the Anglican Francophone community. We can discuss a time that would be beneficial for everyone at a later date.

As always, the following health precautions must be strictly applied:

* Hand disinfection at the entrance.
* Wearing a mask mandatory at all times.
* The chairs will be amply distanced (we are a small group).
* No drinks and no food will be served.

For people attending for the first time, I invite you to read or reread [Your First Quaker Meeting in Six Steps](/about).

The room is kindly donated to us by the Anglican Cathedral of Quebec. As a thank you, a box will be on site to collect donations for the cathedral. The donation is at the sole discretion of each individual and is voluntary.

If you are running late, please do come anyway and sit with us.

You will have guessed that this meeting is totally dependent on the evolution the pandemic. We will be able to confirm the meeting about two days before.

It will be a real pleasure to see you!
