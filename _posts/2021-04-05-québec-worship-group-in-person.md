We are happy to announce that we will carefully resume the in-person meetings [in Quebec](/qc) as of Sunday, May 2 at 1:00 p.m. at the All Saints chapel, [31 rue des Jardins in the Old Town, Qu√©bec](/qc), located in the courtyard of the Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral. Parking is available. You will notice that we had to change our schedule to accommodate the Anglican Francophone community. We can discuss a time that would be beneficial for everyone at a later date.

As always, the following health precautions must be strictly applied:

* Hand disinfection at the entrance.
* Wearing a mask mandatory until you are seated and when moving around the room.
* The chairs will be amply distanced (we are a small group).
* No drinks and no food will be served.

For people attending for the first time, I invite you to read or reread [Your First Quaker Meeting in Six Steps](/about).

The room is kindly donated to us by the Anglican Cathedral of Quebec. As a thank you, a box will be on site to collect donations for the cathedral. The donation is at the sole discretion of each individual and is voluntary.

If you are running late, please do come anyway and sit with us.
