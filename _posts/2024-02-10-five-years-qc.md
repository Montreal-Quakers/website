You had to be a little crazy in 2018 to think about starting a spiritual community in a social context that is resistant to religion and everything connected to it. It was doubly crazy, because Quakers, the spiritual community in question, is fundamentally English in origin, with no roots or familiarity among francophones in Quebec. Moreover, such an introduction was likely to inspire great reservations in a society fighting for its survival against the powerful dominance of the English language. And yet, this small spiritual community celebrated its 5th anniversary this month, looking back to our first worship service held on February 3, 2019.

In the beginning, this assembly was more than modest since we were often only two participants, sometimes only one. I remember that first worship service in the chapel when members of the Montreal Meeting came to support us. There was Breton cake, joy and a prayer read at the opening. What was going to happen to this project? Thankfully, perseverance and the delivery of an online course in French on Quakerism allowed us to grow our numbers a little and strengthen our relationships. Thank you David!

Today we are officially three Quaker members in the Quebec City area and our meeting welcomes about 6 to 10 attenders. Occasionally we welcome some passing visitors from France or the United States, not to mention our faithful and precious friends in Montreal to whom we owe a lot. Their support has been unwavering. A core of &quot;regulars&quot; has been formed and communal projects are gradually emerging. We are few in number but dynamic. On Zoom, we welcome participants from Montreal, the Eastern Townships, Saguenay, Philadelphia and sometimes even the West Indies. It depends.

As we evolved, our little congregation has developed its habits. We had to improvise a bit because documentation in French is very difficult to find and incomplete. In addition, we are isolated from Canada by language, and from France by distance. We then had to customize our ways of doing things and be creative, since we are not tied to any local tradition. Francophone Quakerism in Canada, or even in North America, has never existed before.

For example, we attach great importance to hospitality. In contrast to traditional practices, our assemblies always begin with a word of welcome and some explanation for newcomers about how the meeting unfolds. For us, welcome is more important than silence. Our periods of silence rarely exceed 40 minutes, and then give way to the sharing of joys and sorrows and announcements. The period following the silent worship is certainly one of the most important portions of our encounters, both in duration and spiritual value. Our exchanges, the development of our friendships and self-knowledge are at the heart of these shared moments. Once in a while, we are joined by people curious about this form of worship. Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don&#39;t. Spirituality is a personal matter.
