Every month we strive to hold an event after Sunday meeting (12:30 pm) whose goal is to hold a brief presentation and discussion about one aspect of Quaker life.

This month, on February 20th, 2020, we'll play the Boundaries Game. The Boundaries Game proposes different situations that could arise in meeting, such as someone bringing a dog to sit with them in worship. For each situation, everyone is asked anonymously to say whether this would be "acceptable" and "unacceptable". Then, we discuss only the areas of disagreement -- we might be pacifists but we still love conflict. Joking aside, there might be a lot of different ideas about what a Quaker meeting should be like, none necessarily right or wrong. 

Newcomers and longtime attenders alike are invited to join us for our second time playing this game -- closer community and interesting discussion resulted last time.
