Canadian Yearly Meeting is from August 8th to 14th, 2021.

I encourage all Friends to register for this. It is all on Zoom this year and therefore more easily accessible to a greater number of Friends.

This year it is free with the option of making a donation.

Because it is on Zoom it is possible to join as many or as few sessions as one wishes. The Sunderland P. Gardener lecture is at 5pm on Sunday 8th August and is a “must attend” for many Canadian Friends. The title is “Hope and Justice”

There is a pre-CYM Poetry Retreat on August 7th for which one must register by August 5th.

If you are interested in meeting Friends from across Canada check out [this information page](https://quaker.ca/yearlymeetinginsession/)

In friendship,
Incoming clerk
