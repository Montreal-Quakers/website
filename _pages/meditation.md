Everyone needs a break from the stresses of everyday life, a time for calm and to remember what matters most.

* Meditating alone is difficult; doing so with a community is easier, and leads to a richer and more sustainable practice
* Quaker practice makes meditation easier and richer because occasionally, out of the silence, someone will be moved to share a brief inspiration or story
  * These tidbits make meditation easier than a "pure" meditation
* We have no guided meditation and impose no practice, so all are welcome to practice their way
  * We suggest focusing on what love calls us to do in our life right now (the answer may be: rest!)

The Quaker tree has Christian roots but today has many branches, from non-theist to Christian. [More details about Quaker practice](/about)
