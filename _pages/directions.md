Quaker silent Meeting for Worship is every Sunday from **11:00 a.m. to noon**. We suggest arriving a few minutes before 11:00 but we much prefer your company to your absence! Childcare is available but if possible please do give us a few days [notice](/contact.html).

If this will be your first time at a Quaker Meeting, you may want to read [this information](/about.html) about what to expect.
