## When
* During the academic year (**Sept-Nov, Jan-March**). Because the Newman Centre closes outside these months, [check for updates](#updates) as there may be significant location changes from April through August and in December. 
* **Wednesdays** from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm. We usually provide snacks after.
* We sometimes hold a **book club/Bible study** after. [Contact us](/contact.html) for details.
