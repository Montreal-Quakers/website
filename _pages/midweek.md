During the academic year (Sept-Nov, Jan-March), the Montreal Midweek Quaker Meeting meets every Wednesday, from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm, adjacent to McGill University at the Newman Centre, [3484 Peel Street](https://goo.gl/maps/MeQqk7m8Hegzx9Sz8){:  rel="noopener" target="_blank"}, <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Ryan Library. There may be significant location changes from April through August and in December because the Newman Centre closes during those months.

Enter the Newman Centre from the driveway, proceed up the stairs to the second floor, end of the hallway facing Peel. The Newman Centre is unfortunately not wheelchair accessible.

All are welcome!
