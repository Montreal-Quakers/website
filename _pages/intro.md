Over countless generations, our encounter with Spirit has led us over and over to these six core values:

<i class="far fa-circle fa-fw fa-2x color-1-dark-text" style=""></i> <u>S</u>implicity. Simple living helps us focus on what matters most.

<i class="fas fa-dove fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text" style=""></i> <u>P</u>eace. Quakers have a long history of building peace. 

<i class="fas fa-handshake fa-fw fa-2x color-1-dark-text" style=""></i> <u>I</u>ntegrity. Speaking and living truth as best we can.

<i class="fas fa-comments fa-fw fa-2x color-1-text" style=""></i> <u>C</u>ommunity. Valuing our ties to others.

<i class="fab fa-creative-commons-nd fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text" style=""></i> <u>E</u>quality. Seeing the equal createdness of everything that is.

<i class="fab fa-pagelines fa-fw fa-2x" style="color: darkgreen;"></i> <u>S</u>tewardship. Respect and gratitude for what sustains us.

<br>
These values are not easy, but they are our understanding of how Spirit calls us to live in this world.
