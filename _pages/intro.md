### <i class="fab fa-fly fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text down_a_bit"></i> &nbsp;Meaningful life: Quakers seek clear purpose
  * We aim to be in touch with what is truthful, important, joyous.
  * Each person is called to live differently.
  * Our community exists to give us strength to live boldly.

### <i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h fa-fw fa-2x color-1-text down_a_bit"></i> &nbsp;An accepting community of equals
  * We celebrate leadership but minimize hierarchy; we have no paid positions.
  * Everyone, including children, may be a "minister."
  * No national organization makes decisions for Montreal Quakers.

### <i class="fas fa-road fa-fw fa-2x color-1-dark-text down_a_bit"></i> &nbsp;Open-ended quest: Quakers don't tell people [what to believe](/testimonies) 
  * Of Christian roots, the Quaker tree has many branches, from Christian to non-theist.
  * We love Quaker authors but have no holy book, no articles of faith or creed.
  * We seek loving, meaningful lives using any means that speak to us.

### <i class="fas fa-vial fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text down_a_bit"></i> &nbsp;Quakerism is a running experiment
  * Every week is unique.
  * 400 years later, we're still having fun.
  * Most of us discovered Quakers as adults; we remember being a newcomer.
  * We welcome you to join us in building a better world together.
