[Everyone is welcome](/intro.html) to Quaker worship. The majority of the hour is spent in [silence](/about.html), but those in attendance are more than welcome to share their thoughts if they are moved to do so. After 45 minutes to an hour, the worship closes, followed by tea and social time.  There may be a period for new visitors to ask questions as well.

If this will be your first time at a Quaker Meeting, you may want to read [this information](/about.html) about what to expect.

[Contact us](/contact.html) for details, or contact the worship group directly via email at [quebec@montreal.quaker.ca](mailto:quebec@montreal.quaker.ca){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} or via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QuakersQuebecCanada/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}.

### Mobility
* Parking is available.
* The group meets on the main floor, but up four stairs.
  * The space is therefore unfortunately **not** wheelchair accessible.

  * Translation is available.
  * When we have guests who speak only one language, we can and do translate for them.
  * Nearly everyone understands English.
