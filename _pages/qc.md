Great news! The Quaker Worship Group in Quebec City has begun! Every first Sunday of the month, Quebec City Quakers will meet at 11 a.m. at [31 rue des Jardins, Québec](https://www.google.com/maps/search/31%20rue%20des%20Jardins,%20Qu%C3%A9bec) (the building in the courtyard of the Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral in Old Québec)

[Everyone is welcome](intro.html) to Quaker worship. The meditation is [largely silent](about.html) but if the experience moves people to share a thought, that is welcome too. After 45 minutes to an hour, the worship closes, followed by tea and social time. There may be a period of questions for new visitors as well.
