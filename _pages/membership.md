### The role of membership for Montreal Quakers
Some people, for various reasons, attend meeting and even serve on Quaker committees for many years without being a member. Anyone, member or attender, is welcome at meeting, can attend and express themselves at business meeting, and can even serve on committees. That said, membership also is important, even if there are few specific distinctions or privileges that come with it.
### The purpose of membership
* We are all shaped by experiences. At some point, becoming a member — "being" a Quaker — is simply an honest statement that we have been shaped by this Quaker community, among other influences
* Membership should be a leading from Spirit, in other words, an expression of the miracle of love for this community, our participation in a kind of spiritual family
* The purpose of the membership process is to discern whether this miracle has happened, and if so, to recognize and celebrate it
* Membership also serves to signal a desire for inclusion and contribution

### The membership process
1. The interested person writes a letter to the Clerk stating a wish to apply for membership. This letter can be long or short and may answer questions such as:
  * How long have you been attending?
  * How involved are you?
  * What makes you want to be a member?
  * What has your faith journey been like?
2. Give that letter to the clerk by hand, mail or email.
3. Someone from the Ministry & Counsel committee will be in touch to ask about who would be best to serve on the clearness committee for membership
4. The Clerk will read your letter and form a committee at the next business meeting
5. At the clearness committee meeting, committee members will ask you questions about your faith journey, your relationship with wider Quakerism, what you receive and wish to give to the community, and how you see your relationship as a member going forward.
6. The clearness committee will craft a recommendation, which will be presented at the following business meeting.
7. The community will accept or reject the recommendation of the clearness committee.
8. If accepted, the most important step: party! <i class="fas fa-birthday-cake fa-fw color-1-text"></i> The miracle of community is meant to be celebrated.
