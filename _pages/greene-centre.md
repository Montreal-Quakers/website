### Health precautions <span class="stanchor"><a name="precautions"></a></span>

For visitors:
* If you're experiencing symptoms (flu, COVID, upset stomach, etc.), please visit us at a later time.

Our precautions that are always in effect: 

* The two air purifiers in the sunroom will remain on at medium before, during and after worship. An attempt will be made to keep their fans functioning at a low noise level and yet at an effective speed.
* Chairs will remain well spaced.
* At least a couple of windows will be opened (a fraction in cold weather, temperature permitting, more in warm weather).
* The meeting will obtain high quality (N95 or KN95) masks to give to anyone who wants to wear a mask, and will make it known that they are available.
* We encourage attenders experiencing gastric or respiratory symptoms to visit us at a later time.

Moreover, we encourage those still concerned about their safety after enactment of the above provisions, to [contact us](/contact) for assistance with the following:

* To sit close to an air purifier
* Assistance (both material and financial) in purchasing a superior quality mask which provides enhanced safety in conditions such as ours. The meeting will have information and advice available on this topic.

Finally, note that we provide two online Zoom meetings weekly. The Sunday Zoom is connected to the in-presence meeting at the Greene Centre. People attend these meetings for various reasons, including a desire to minimize contact with others and prevent illness.

Anyone with comments or concerns about our policy is encouraged to [contact us](/contact).
