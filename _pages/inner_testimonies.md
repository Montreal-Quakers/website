Over hundreds of years, we have found that regular participation in Quaker community reinforces the values below, called the 7 C's:

<i class="fa-solid fa-water fa-fw fa-2x color-1-dark-text down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>alm. The inner state of peace we practice in worship, an inner ease invincible to wordly noise and complexity. This peace is the root of Quakerism.

<i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-to-dot fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>oncentration. Exploring ideas. Making sound decisions strengthens individuals and communities.

<i class="fa-regular fa-circle fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>onsideration. All are equally worth being heard. Listening to ourselves, others, God. Quaker worship helps us listen “between the lines.”

<i class="fa-solid fa-mountain fa-fw fa-2x color-1-text down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>larity. When appropriate, letting go of inner doubt and noise into inner simplicity.

<i class="fa-solid fa-dove fa-fw fa-2x color-1-light-text down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>ourage, without which all good decisions are for naught. This is the inner integrity that leads to action and even risk.

<i class="fa-solid fa-music fa-fw fa-2x down_a_bit_more"></i> &nbsp;<b>C</b>reation. This is meaningful living, the stewardship of joyful action.

<i class="fas fa-heart fa-fw fa-2x down_a_bit_more heart"></i> &nbsp; <b>C</b>are. The greatest gift which we have all been given is Love.
