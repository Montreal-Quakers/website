## Mandatory Health Precautions for Any In-Person Meeting <span class="stanchor"><a name="precautions"></a></span>
* Disinfect hands at the entrance.
* Wearing a mask, covering nose and mouth, is mandatory at all times.
* The chairs will be amply distanced (we are a small group).
* Neither drink nor food will be served.
* We must disinfect surfaces before and after meeting (The Greene Centre will do this for us).
* Those attending meetings at the Greene Centre must be fully vaccinated -- this means that we're asking children under 12 who aren't vaccinated to wait.
