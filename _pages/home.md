## [About Quakers](/intro) 

Quakers are a community of seekers with diverse beliefs. We seek meaningful life, an accepting community, and doing good in the world. 

Quakers cherish humanity, perceiving an Inner Light or “that of God” in every human being. Love is the source of [Quaker values](/testimonies) and our peace-building work.

We are an active and affirming community &nbsp;[![Rainbow flag](/assets/images/Rainbow-Flag.jpg){: height="22" width="36" class="down_a_tad"}](/intro)&nbsp; All are welcome.

## [Quaker practice](/about)
The centre of the Quaker meeting is our quiet [meeting for worship](/about). We sit and seek a stillness together, without any special leaders. Hard to describe, we enter into a kind of communion with each other, the world, and with the divine presence. Sometimes out of this silent unity comes a message — someone may speak, read, pray or even sing.

We are Quakers of all kinds — Christian Quakers, nontheist Quakers, Buddhist Quakers, and more — gathered in a circle around our 400-year old practice and our common quest to better [live love](/intro).
