Quakers joyfully welcome children at meeting.

We offer two options: 

1. What we call First Day School in a separate room, with drawing and readings. This is a fun way for children to get to know us and for us to know them and the Quakers.
2. Children are welcome in meeting as well! We can offer:
  - Crafts (e.g. paper & markers)
  - Books
  - A blanket for younger children to sit on the floor 

## First Day School
First Day School, our relgious education, is scheduled for the third Sunday of every month.

## Children's noise in meeting
For parents who opt to have their child in meeting, we understand that many parents will feel self-conscious that their child, especially if that child very young, will make noise during Quaker meeting. Some parents understandably fear that this noise will disrupt the meeting.

We just want you to know that, from our perspective, children are a gift at meeting.

We are at meeting not to hear silence but to hear the divine. Quakers view what children say as a form of ministry. We love their presence and their questions, rustling and all.
