Quakers joyfully welcome children at meeting.

We offer two options: 1) what we call First Day School in a separate room, with drawing and readings. We love getting to know kids this way. Or 2) children are welcome in meeting as well! 
## First Day School
Please do give us some advanced warning where possible, as we don't have First Day School set up every week!

## Noise
We understand that many parents will feel self-conscious that their child, especially if that child very young, will make noise during Quaker meeting. Parents fear that this noise will disrupt the meeting. We just want you to know that, from our perspective, children are a gift at meeting. We love hearing what they have to say -- Quakers view what children say as a form of ministry. We are at meeting not to hear silence but to hear the divine, even if we may understand this in diverse ways.
