title: Of carrots and belief-system pie -- why I am a Quaker

The short answer to why I am a Quaker is because of the Vietnam War. In 1968, while participating in an over- night peace vigil in a downtown Cleveland Church, I came to the unsettling conclusion that I had to become a pacifist. The most dedicated pacifists I knew were the Quakers. I had observed, during the war, how these quiet committed people practised what they preached. Years later I heard Jan de Hartog speak at the Friends World Committee for Consultation Triennial. In describing what it means to be a Quaker he said, “You cannot define a Quaker. To understand Quaker beliefs, you must encounter one.”

Indeed, I had encountered one Quaker (a student of my husband’s in Cleveland) who took me to my first meeting. It wasn’t easy the first time to sit still in silence. And so the transition occurred gradually. After arriving in Montreal in 1970, I began to attend Montreal Monthly Meeting regularly. When one member queried me about my belief system, I explained how it resembled a pie with different slices representing various segments of my beliefs: 
* one quarter was for Buddhism, which preached rejection of worldly goods; 
* one quarter for the esoteric mystical part of my Catholic roots I still clung to; 
* one quarter for Unitarianism with its appealing non-trinitarian approach to the creator; 
* one quarter for Quakerism with its emphasis on pacifism and the inner light.

In time, of course, I came to realise that my belief-system pie could be Quaker and I could add whatever ecumenical flavours or spices I wanted to suit my theological taste.

The eclectic, non dogmatic nature of Quakerism had a strong appeal to me. I had grown up, heavily marked by Catholicism with its emphasis on priestly authority, sin and redemption. During my twenties and early thirties, I had rejected this for a bland intellectual humanism. With the Quakers, I was offered a chance to construct and tailor a coherent system of beliefs based, not on hierarchy and ritual, but on continuing revelation and experiencing the transcendent as an inner guide.

In reflecting upon the theme of how I was drawn to Quakerism, I uncovered another food metaphor in addition to my belief system pie. With the season of planting and growth approaching, I was led during a morning meditation to think about carrots. Carrots are nourished in the earth below the topsoil. In a field of carrots, you see only the leafy green feathery tops blowing in the wind. But what is important is what’s growing below the surface. So, too, our spirits are nourished by what occurs within the rich soil of our inner lives, our daily and weekly worship.

Carrots, quietly growing under the surface, remind me of an old British folk tale called “Tops and Bottoms” featuring a goblin who tries to outwit a farmer by driving a bargain to take the “tops” of his harvest and leave the “bottoms” to the farmer. The goblin, of course, expects to gain a field of wheat or corn but the farmer plants carrots and successfully upsets the goblin’s scheme. Our outer selves, our public selves, are like the leafy green tops of carrots and other root vegetables, but what really matters is what’s growing beneath the soil in our inner selves during our quiet times.

I have heard it said that it is hard work to be a Quaker. And I am sure most Quakers would agree. It is useful to question what it is that guides us on our life’s journey. As I continued to ponder on carrots during worship, I realized that folk wisdom holds that carrots sharpen one’s vision, particularly in the darkness. And when I think of carrots, I am led to realise that as I journey and occasionally falter along my path it is the carrot of Quakerism which draws me onward and guides me and helps me to stay on the road I have chosen.
