As a COVID-19 prevention measure, the Sunday Quaker meeting, the Quebec City group, and the Wednesday midweek meeting will meet online until at least May 1st, 2020. This webpage and our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MontrealQuakers/) will have updates as we learn more. 
 
**Update: weâ€™ll be having an online midweek and Sunday meeting for worship, Wednesday at _7 pm_ and Sundays at 11 am on Zoom. [Contact us](contact.html) for details!**
 
There are also other opportunities for online worship. This page will be updated for Canadian options, but there is the Woodbrooke Centre with [online worship](https://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/about/online-mfw/) a few times a week, or check out this [list of other options](https://westernfriend.org/quaker-worship-and-fellowship-online), including Pendle Hill, and the [Ben Lomond Center](http://www.quakercenter.org/meeting-for-worship/).
