* Most highly recommended: [Quaker Faith and Podcast](https://quakerpodcast.org/category/episodes/season-2/) by Mackenzie and Micah. 
  * It struggles with the big questions of what do Quakers believe. They write: "Most Quakers today were not raised Quakers. In Britain, that’s as high as 87%! That’s a lot of religion education to pick up, and smaller meetings often have trouble providing education for the full learning curve from newcomer to seasoned Quaker. We hope to make it easier to learn what Quaker believe."
* Second, [QuakerSpeak](http://quakerspeak.com/newest-videos/) speaks to Quakers about their Faith. 
  * QuakerSpeak is a Quaker YouTube channel where Jon interviews Friends of all different backgrounds and ask them the core questions of our faith. 
  * There is a [podcast version](http://quakerspeak.com/podcast/) but the videos are always more up to date.
* The [Young Quaker Podcast](https://youngquakerpodcast.libsyn.com/) is just that, a podcast made by and made for young Quakers in Britain. 
  * Their podcast of a 30 minute-long Meeting for Worship got a lot of media coverage: 
    * The Guardian declared it an [ocean of calm](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/apr/08/an-oasis-of-calm-quaker-groups-30-minutes-of-silence-podcast?CMP=share_btn_fb)
    * NPR broadcast that [silence is golden](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/09/600761741/for-quaker-podcast-silence-is-golden).
* [Quaker Take](https://www.quaker.org.uk/our-work/podcast#heading-1) (used to be called Q:Witness) is a podcast from Quakers in Britain featuring people talking about ideas, faith and activism. 
  * It's very Britain focused and also very much activism focused. 
* **On Being** is an excellent non-Quaker specific podcast that speaks to and about Quaker faith. Host Krista Tippett talks to Friends like:
  * [Katy Payne](https://onbeing.org/programs/katy-payne-in-the-presence-of-elephants-and-whales/)
  * [Carrie Newcommer](https://onbeing.org/programs/carrie-newcomer-a-conversation-with-music/)
  * [Parker Palmer](https://onbeing.org/programs/the-soul-in-depression-mar2018/) (who also writes blog posts on this site)
  * It's worth listening to the interviews with all kinds of people of faith 
* [Spirit in Action](https://www.northernspiritradio.org/program/spirit-action) is part of Northern Spirit Radio, founded by Mark Helpsmeet in 2005 with the support of the Eau Claire Friends Meeting in Wisconsin. 
  * We recommend: [Spirit In The Digital Age: Quakers & Technology](https://www.northernspiritradio.org/episode/spirit-digital-age-quakers-technology)
  * [Fit for Freedom not Friendship](https://www.northernspiritradio.org/episode/fit-freedom-not-friendship-donna-mcdaniel-and-vanessa-julye)
  * [Earth-Community Values & Money Dilemmas](https://www.northernspiritradio.org/episode/earth-community-values-money-dilemmas)
  * [QVS: Service Beyond Americorps](https://www.northernspiritradio.org/episode/qvs-service-beyond-americorps)
* Oldie but a goodie: [Friend Speaks My Mind](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blog/list?user=1tp2cvzkthqyv)
* The Woodbrooke Quaker Study Centre in the UK has a [collection](https://www.woodbrooke.org.uk/resource-type/audio/) of audio based lectures and talks that are worth a listen. 
* Pendle Hill, the Quaker study centre in Pennsylvania, also has some great [lectures online](https://pendlehill.org/learn/live-recorded-lectures/#.W-rX3JNKg2w). 
* Finally, we benefit from listening from Quakers who worship and pray in very different ways from us, so also recommended is the [Pelham Friends Church's podcast](http://www.pelhamfriends.ca/history/) which is the podcast from the Evangelical Friends Church in southern Ontario. One recent podcast (sermon) is from a Friends Pastor from the Evangelical Friends Church-Eastern Region ([EFCER](https://www.efcer.org/)). 
* You can also hear the Matt Legge from the Canadian Friends Service Committee on the Canadian Council of Churches' [Faith and Witness podcast](http://faithandwitness.libsyn.com/redesigning-the-tree-of-life) where he talks about a conference on Synthetic Biology in November, 2018.
