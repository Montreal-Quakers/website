To those who have been coming to our meeting and are curious for next steps, first of all, congratulations. This page has some suggestions that might interest you. 

### Deepen your knowledge of Quakerism
* Join us once a month as we have an introduction to Quaker event at meeting
  * For instance, [a presentation on the Quaker Institute for the Future](/2020/04/14/quaker-institute-future.html)
* Check out a pamphlet or book from our library about Quakerism and Quaker history. Feel free to ask for suggestions.
* Online courses in Quakerism are offered by Canadian Yearly Meeting. You can browse the material anytime [here](http://quaker.ca/resources/education/#Introduction_to_Quakers_and_Friends_Ways){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}. If you're interested, [contact us](/contact) to be put on their mailing list
* Ask someone to have coffee to speak more in depth and from personal experience

### Build deeper relationships with us
If you'd like to be more involved but you're not sure how, perhaps the best thing to do is to express this feeling to the clerk, nominations committee, Ministry & Counsel member, or just ask around. Sometimes we are simply unaware of your wish. Here are a couple of other suggestions:
* Joining a [committee](/committees.html) is a great way to know us better
  * If one of the committees above might interest you, feel free to inquire. No pressure, and the question is appreciated
  * If you don't see a role that might interest you, perhaps ask around anyway: there are many fascinating ways to join and serve Quakers in Canada, North America, the UN, and the world. That list is only the beginning
* [Attend](/contact.html) our book club/Bible study or singing group sometime
* Attend [Regional Gathering](https://stlawrence.quaker.ca){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} or [Canadian Yearly Meeting](https://quaker.ca){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"} or perhaps even [Friends General Conference](https://www.fgcquaker.org/){: rel="noopener" target="_blank"}
* Have you considered becoming a [member](/membership.html)?
  * Here's more information about [membership](/membership.html) and the process we use

### Helpful resources
In addition, feel free to request any of these resources to integrate better into the meeting:
* Meeting contact list
* Internal meeting listserv (rarely used, but only for members and current regular attenders)
* List of current committee members
* Meeting budget
* Past business meeting minutes

### Request help
As an attender, you more than are welcome to request help from the meeting, which can take several forms:
* We can form a Clearness Committee to help members and attenders make important and difficult decisions
* Members and attenders can apply for [emergency financial help](/discretionary_fund) from the meeting of up to $250, up to twice a year.
* A Committee of Care can be created to help care for and support a member or attender in need, for instance, in case of hospitalization or stress
* Our Ministry & Counsel committee can help find other kinds of support for members and attenders. You are not alone
* During the COVID outbreak, we set up a special fund to help members and attenders. Feel free to ask us anytime how we're responding to challenging circumstances

### Asking vs. being asked
If you've been with us for a while, hopefully someone has discussed many of these items with you. If we haven't approached you, it may be because:
* We're a volunteer organization; we may not be as pro-active as some places with paid staff due to limited volunteer energy
* It is completely against our [values](/intro) to pressure people into serving on committees or membership. We are leery — sometimes too leery — of arm-twisting, sometimes hesitate quite a bit before bringing up some of these topics, particularly membership.
  * We want the Spirit of love, and not a sense of obligation, to guide decisions

We know it's awkward to ask; we hope you'll be patient with us. Knowing your interests helps us welcome you better, so thank you.
